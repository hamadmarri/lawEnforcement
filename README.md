# lawEnforcement
This is my final year project for the B.Eng. in Software Systems Engineering at the university of Regina

# Concept Statement
Law Enforcement is a software project to facilitate law enforcement processes such as opening and managing different types of police cases. It allows workflow and open/foreword a case to be a special case for investigation, which includes a workflow process such as approval or deny the process. Also, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be implemented so the software will be able to classify the criminal/s based on the case inputs and apply crime prevention for youth at risk by collected and analyzing the history of a young person and the software will be able to classify that person if he/she has high probability of being a criminal in the future.
